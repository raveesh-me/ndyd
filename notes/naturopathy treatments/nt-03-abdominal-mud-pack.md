### Introduction
Ancient texts including `Atharva Veda` describe the healing qualities of mud. Western civilisations have also accepted these qualities and their importance.
In the modern era, `Adolf Just` is known as who introduces using mud in healing practices.

### Requirements
- Pure Mud
- Water
- Piece of Cloth(Blanked) (12”x18”)
- Wooden Tray
	- L(12”-16”) X W(8”) X D(1/2” - 3/4”)
### Qualities of Mud
Application of mud:
* Provides a cooling effect
* Absorbs toxins from the skin
* Strengthens the muscles
* Loosens the faecal matter stuck in the intestines

> An abdominal mud pack is best followed by a simple enema.

### Principle
This treatment works by keeping the abdomen consistently cool for 30 minutes.

### Preparation
- To make a mud pack, we pick a clean place to take mud from
- We dig 2-3ft and extract the mud
- The mud is kept in sun for the whole day (worms and insects get out during this time)
- Now we blend the mud finely and then sieve it into fine powder
- Wet this mud in water for 8-10 hours
- Now mix the mud into a paste
- First we apply a fine layer of dry mud to the tray to avoid stickiness
- Now we fill the tray with the paste
- Spread the paste in the tray
- Make the top surface smooth with a light hand
- make the patient lie down in a relaxed supine position and lift their upper garment up, exposing the abdomen and part of the groin
- Flip the tray on the patient’s stomach ensuring the mud is consistent and
	- starts from 2” above the navel
	- ends down to as low as it can go(mud is 8” Wide)
	- the length covers as much of the stomach from side to side as possible
- cover the mud surface with a blanket piece
- if the patient is feeling cold cover them whole with another blanket
- after the complete duration, remove the mud from the abdomen and wipe with the cloth
- ask the patient to take an enema as per requirement.
### Duration
The duration of mud pack depends on the patient’s endurance and overall vitality.

| Condition              | Duration      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Normal Patients        | 20-30 minutes |
| Weak / Feeble Patients | 20 minutes    |
### Action / Reaction
> Mud is soothing in nature. Mud prepared my our method can be applied to wounds and burns with a sterilised and disinfected cloth in between the mud and the skin

The blood vessels of place of application of mud get vasoconstriction.
Blood flows towards the internal organs, loosening the toxins and moving towards excretory organs for effective excretion.

Mud is also heavy and compresses the place of application. Making the muscles stronger.

Mud is also porous. As it dries on the outside, it creates an osmotic suction at its interface with the skin. Thus pulling the toxins into itself and away from the body.

Overall, mud:
- Strengthens the walls of the intestines
- Sucks toxins through the skin
- Reduces inflammation
- Loosens the waste in the abdomen
- Provides a cooling effect

### Indications
- Constipation
- Gastritis
- Excess Gas
- Acute and Chronic Fever
- Indigestion
- Acidity
- Skin Disease
- Piles
- Prickly Heat
- Epistaxis (Nasal Bleed)
- Insect Bite
- Liver enlargement (Swollen / Fatty Liver)
- Urinal Irritation / Bleeding
- Pancreatitis
etc

### Contra Indications
* Rigor Fever (Chills)
* Asthma in its acute state
* Sciatica in its acute state
* Heart Diseases
	* Mud packs increase the blood flow by immediate compression. Might lead to complications when there are blockages in circulatory system
### Precautions
- The mud should be a fine blend. There should not be pieces that could nip the skin
- This treatment should be given on empty stomach, or 3-4 hours after eating
- If the patient feels cold / shivers, make sure to cover him with a blanket
- On open wounds / burns make sure to keep a disinfected cloth between the mud and the wound.
