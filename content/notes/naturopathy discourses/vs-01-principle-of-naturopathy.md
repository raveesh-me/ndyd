>Nature cure is a simple system. In this, we remedy the bodily functions, not cure diseases.

Nature cure is the only system of healing that emphasises on not getting diseased. It proposes lifestyle changes and techniques that prevent us from getting ill and if a disease knocks, allows us to manage them in a way that it does not get worse.

The human body is a smart apparatus. If we follow certain rules that are set for it by nature, we will never go ill.

Diseases occur when we break the rules of the nature and subject our body to habits it is not made for. The most frequently broken rule on our end is `eating more than we need.`

Innumerable tissues in our body work from the food that we eat. The food that we eat gets digested into usable energy and waste.

The generated waste has four natural ways of exiting the body:
1. Stool
2. Urine
3. Sweat
4. Exhale

If food that we eat is of a kind or quantity that generates more waste than our body can naturally expel, it leads to accumulation. Short term accumulation leads to body finding alternate ways of expulsion.
These forms of expulsions are called minor symptoms / small diseases:
* Expulsion through the mouth might be vomiting
* Expulsion through skin might be a fever
* Expulsion through the food pipe might be lose motion
etc

According to nature cure, we should welcome this expulsion as a part of how our body is cleaning itself. Most of these accumulation related short term diseases can be treated naturally by:
1. Stop eating
2. Stop working (take rest)
3. Drink lots of water

Leading our usual life as we get these reactions from our body, we panic and resort to suppressing these reactions with medication or other means. This leads to long term accumulation that takes the form of chronic diseases.

> These are as described in detail in the book: `रोगों की सरल चिकित्सा`


These chronic diseases take longer to recover from. This calls for enforcing a diet and set of activities that empower and clean the 4 natural ways of expulsion. To keep doing it till all the unwanted matter is out.

> This method is how someone gets healthy. They also can and must follow this method throughout the life if they want to remain healthy.

### Empowering the Stool Path
This is done by eating things with a lot of roughage, and rejecting things that compete with the natural functions of the body.

* Fruits and Fruit Peel has the highest amount of roughage. However, modern business practices have spoiled the peels with chemicals. Any fruit that can be peeled should be peeled before consumption.
* Grapes if need to be eaten should only be eaten after placing them under running water for at least 15 minutes.
* Any vegetable that can be eaten raw, should be eaten raw.
* Smoothies are fine
* Wheat should be with its fiber
* Rice eaten should be unpolished
* Pulses should always be germinated before eating. Ungerminated pulses are only digestible to people of high physical labour.
* Three white poisons are anti-roughage and must be avoided:
	* White Sugar
		* Sugar to Glucose conversion takes calcium away from the bones
		* Sugar to glucose takes B complex away from the nerves
		* Sugar forces insulin production in the pancreas
		* Sugar forces liver glucose to accumulate
		* Sugar has nothing but its calorific value which is useless
	* White Flour - Sticky
	* White Rice - Can not be chewn, Gives bad sugar
* Jaggery is the best alternative to sugar. It provides:
	* Roughage
	* Vitamins
	* Minerals
	* Iron
	* etc
* Eat last nights roti rather than eat brown bread (in Indian context)
* Biscuits, Packaged drinks, Packaged anything must be avoided at all costs

### Empowering the Urinal Path
* Three juices are great diuretics(In the order):
	* Ash Gourd Juice
	* Bottle Gourd Juice
	* Cucumber Juice
* Drink at least 2-3 Litres of water every day
* Water should be of body temperature
* Any type of plastic storage is wrong
* Glass container is best
* Earthen pots are also best for temperature control

### Empowering the Sweat Path
Must sweat at least 1 hour a day in a well oxygenated environment.
* Walking at a normal pace for 55 minutes followed by 5 minutes of running is enough to lead a healthy life
* Recovering from something or preparing for something may demand more
* Pain is the indication to stop

### Empowering the Exhale
Walking / Air bath at least 1 hour a day in a clean and highly oxygenated environment also takes care of our oxygen levels for the rest of the day.
> This one hour you walk today will insure your life for the next 23. Do it again tomorrow to be insured for the next day.

That said we should also try if in our power to avoid polluted environments as they have the worst effect on our vitality.
