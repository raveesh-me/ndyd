> Diseases are only present where there are toxins.

When waste material can’t exit the body via the 4 designated paths, body finds alternative ways of expulsion. This expulsion creates symptoms that we in common culture call acute diseases.
Common examples are:
* Stool -> Lose Motion
* Mouth -> Vomiting
* Nose -> Cough n Cold
* Skin -> Fever, Itching, Rashes, Acne
Routine mishandling of these acute diseases results in chronic ailments.
### Treatment
Treatment of acute diseases is done by observing three rules:
* Stop Eating
* Stop Working (Take Rest)
* Drink Lots of Water

This is as simple as it sounds, and the rest of the discourse was Vimal Sir sharing his experiences on how to help patients observe these rules. I will try to structure this as much as possible:
### Fasting vs Dieting
In naturopathy, a fast (`उपवास`) means going without food. One is allowed to have only:
1. Water
2. Lemon Water
3. Lemon Honey Water
> Vitamin B and C are water soluble and excess usually gets filtered by the kidneys and it is usually safe to consume as much lemons we want for taste as it helps us drink the required amount of water.

>Even healthy people should fast at least once a week/month. Associating this with a religious significance can help maintain the routine.

Anything outside this, although restricted in its own way, is a Diet (`आहर`).
### Small Children and Others who Can’t Fast
Most small children can’t observe a fast. In this case, we should help them observe a diet with as less food as possible. 
Children need to be fooled into fasting and drinking water by mixing these items in water:
* Fruit Juices
* Carrot and Tomato Juices
* Vegetable Soups
* Vegetable Juices
Children find that added taste helps them drink more water and not feel hungry. Solid food outside the list above should be avoided.

> These juices should be given not as food, but as an illusion to make kids fast and drink water.

> इलाज तो उपवास ही है।

There can be other patients that are not in a position to observe a fast. This might be due to feebleness, old age, or other reasons. In all these cases, we should reduce their diet to as little as possible. Partial fasting will lead to longer recovery times, but eating less will still help.

### Water
Water is easy to feed. 
Dehydration is the most dangerous possible outcome of an acute condition. It is only in vomiting tendencies that a patient would not want to drink water.

Even in those cases, we should reduce the rate at which we make the patient drink water down to one spoon at a time if needed. We should always make the patient drink water.

> Lose motion, vomiting, fever, cough — Keep drinking water

### Coming out of the Fast
Coming straight back to the regular diet after a fast is dangerous.
Once the acute disease is gone, we need to follow a ramp up process:

| Day After Disease | Recommended Diet                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Day 1             | Juices                                 |
| Day 2             | Fruits                                 |
| Day 3             | Half Food: 2x Fruits, 1x Solid Food    |
| Day 4             | Regular Diet: 2x Fruits, 2x Solid Food |
### Mud Pack and Enema
Fast can be complimented by mud pack and enema to further help the body get rid of waste and strengthen the body to work well.

>The large intestines are responsible for:
> * Absorbing water
> * Ejecting faeces
>
>Peristaltic movement is the wavy movement of food in the alimentary canal. 
> * If the movement is too fast, Large intestines will not be able to absorb enough water and it will lead to lose motion. 
> * If the movement is too slow, large intestines will absorb too much water and it will lead to constipation.

#### Abdominal Mud Pack
Abdominal Mud Pack:
* Normalises the peristaltic movement of the alimentary canal
* Cools the abdomen
* Strengthens the colon / large intestine
* Promotes / Regulates Absorption
* Loosens the stuck faecal matter from the intestinal walls
* Reduces the acuteness of the disease and increases the endurance of the body

A mud pack is given by placing a lump of mud 0.5” thick from two inches above the navel to as low as possible towards the groin, covering the entire width of the stomach as long as the lump does not break. This will be described in depth in a note of its own.

Mud is porous and keeps the touching surface consistently cool while providing a suction effect on the skin. Mud absorbs all the toxins while producing a calming, cooling and compressing effect.

In cases where mud is not available, a towel can be folded to >1” thick and placed on the abdomen wet. We will need to keep flipping the towel every 2-3 minutes to make sure that the cooler surface is touching the skin. This will produce the closest possible effect to a mud pack.
#### Enema
In a fast we are not taking any food. This disrupts the flow in the alimentary canal. To keep the abdomen clean, we use enema to help with the outflow of waste.
It is especially useful after a mud pack has loosened the faecal matter in the large intestine.

> Tap water enema is a completely safe treatment. It is the only non-irritating way for cleaning the intestines and can be administered for as many times as required for as many days as required without any side effects whatsoever.

> The notion of ”building a dependency on enema” comes from when soap water(or other additives) are mixed in the tap water.

> In the diseased state, patient should take abdominal mud pack and enema daily.

#### Massage
A Massage can enable a healthy practitioner to share his vitality with the patient. A careful and scientific massage can relax the patient, work on the musculoskeletal system and provide them with new vitality to help fight the disease off.
> A paid servant can not give the best massage.

### Common Fevers

| Fever         | Support                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chickenguinea | 21 days fast if the patient can keep up                                                                                          |
| Malaria       | Malaria comes with a chilly fever. Steam bath 30 minutes before the fever followed by whole body wet sheet pack during the fever |
| Typhoid       | The antibiotics given during typhoid are only to avoid secondary infections. Fasting is preferred regardless.                    |
