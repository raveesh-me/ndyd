History taking is the art of speaking to the patient and extracting vital information to reach a diagnosis and subsequently, a plan of treatment.

A patient is defined as someone who is distress. Our jobs as aspiring physicians is to take that distress away. History taking helps us to identify the distress, without which we can not work to take that away.

History taking is also important from a documentation pespective should a patient come again.
It is done in steps:

### BioData of The Patient
* Name
* Age (Very Important)
* Marital Status (More important in women)
* Occupation
* Address

### Chief Complain / Present Illness
Pain is the most common complaint that brings a patient to the doctor. Fever is the second.

### History of Present Illness
Order of symptoms is important, and can affirm the diagnosis based on our general knowledge.

For pain:
* Since When(Age)
* Site of Pain
* Character of Pain
* Severity of Pain
* Radiation (Does pain travel from one site to another)
* Aggravating and relieving factors.

### Past Illness
Diabetes / Blood Pressure / Thyroid / TB

* Drug and Surgical History
	* long cough / long fever is usually indicative of past TB
	* 6-8 month medicine courses are usually TB

We have to figure out techniques of extracting information which patient does not know about their medical history. This can be attained with experience and increased general knowledge.

### Family History
BP / Diabetes / Thyroid / Cancer

These indications can be passed on from the parent to child so good to ask for them.

Polyphagia(Excessive Eating) / Polydypsia(Excessive thirst) / Polyurea(Excessive Urination) together almost always point towards diabetes.

### Personal History
* Bladder and Bowel activities
* Addictions (Tobacco / Smoking / Drinking etc)
* Food Preference (Veg / Non Veg)
* Allergies
* Sleep Patterns
* Recent sudden(non voluntary) loss / gain in weight

### Menstrual History
(In rural areas, crucial in finding causes for anaemia)
* Regularity (28-30 days cycle)
* Bleeding days (3-5 days is normal)
* Painful?
* Parity3Abortion4Live2 PAL is measured to detect loss of blood amongst other things.
### General Examination
