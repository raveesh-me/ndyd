>योगः चित्तवृत्ति निरोधः।

>योगः कर्मशु कौशलम।

The literal meaning of Yoga is `to Join`, or `To bring together`.
Yoga is a process for liberation of self. It is an infallible way to get the mind and body in balance.

In today’s upbringing, it is easy for the mind to lead us astray. Our mind, our body and our spirit could be working towards three separate directions. The aim of yoga is to bring these three together in unison.

Yoga was developed in the Indian subcontinent moe than 10000 years ago in the `Tantrik Culture`. Normal people were scared of Yoga and Yogis were usually considered mystics who were out of the reach for common people.

Archaeologists found idols of Shiva and Parvati in different yogic positions in the excavations of Harappa and Mohenjodaro(modern day Pakistan). We consider Shiva as the origin / originator of Yoga, and his consort Parvati as his first disciple.

Great Sage Patanjali understood the importance of Yoga for the common man and his society. He dedicated his life to make Yoga and Yogic Practice accessible to the masses. 
His definition of Yoga is:

>योगः चित्तवृत्ति निरोधः।

>Yoga is the control of the whims of mind

In Hindu culture, `Bhagvat Geeta` is an important guiding scripture. It defines Yoga as:

>योगः कर्मशु कौशलम।

> Yoga is doing everything with competence.
