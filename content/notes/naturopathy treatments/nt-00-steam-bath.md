description: A detailed discussion on Steam Bath, how to administer, and precautions.

### Introduction
Steam Bath is administered to expel unwanted foreign matter from the body by inducing sweating through activation of sweat glands and dilation of skin pores.
This can be administered as:
* Local steam bath
* Whole body steam bath
This will discuss in detail the whole body steam bath.

### Equipments
* Steam Bath Cabinet
* Kettle
* Stove
* Rubber Tube
* Small Towel
* Large Towel
* Hip Bath Tub
* A Mug
* Cold Water
* Drinking Glass

### Principle
The primary function of skin is to maintain the temperature of the body. Consistent contact with steam heats the outer surface of the skin. To maintain this change in temperature, sweat glands become active and skin pores get dilated thus inducing sweat. This sweat carries unwanted foreign matter out of the body.
A cold hip bath after the steam bath pushes the blood towards the internal organs and increases circulation, activating other excretory functions and thus further cleaning the body.

### Method
* Fill the kettle and put it on stove
  700-800ML is enough for one person
* Attach one end of the rubber pipe to the kettle and other end to the steam cabinet
* Wait till cabinet gets filled with steam and becomes warm
* Make the patient drink water
* Make the patient sit in the cabinet according to their height
* Close the cabinet and wet the patient's head
* Put a small wet towel on the patient's head to prevent heat buildup
* Put the larger towel around the patient's neck to prevent steam for escaping
* Instruct the patient to rub themselves inside the cabinet with light hands. This will easily remove the dead skin cells
* Keep pouring cold water on patient's head at regular intervals.
* Based on season and patient's endurance, this can last from 10 to 20 minutes.
* Once done, instruct the patient to take a cold hip bath
* In the end, instruct the patient to wipe the body and wear their clothes.

### Duration
In winters - 15-20 minutes
In summer - 10-15 minutes

Based on patient endurance, it can vary by 5 minutes up and down
For children below 12, local steam should be enough.

### Action / Reaction
The heat from the steam leads to dilation in the capillaries of the skin. This leads to flow of blood from internal organs to the skin.

Sweat glands become activated to maintain surface temperature and skin pores open up. Sweating increases and this is how external matter gets ejected from the body.

Subsequently bathing with cold water leads to compression in the blood vessels. With this dilation and compression, blood circulation gets increased.

Blockages in blood vessels go away and metabolism corrects itself. Unwanted matter reach the excretory organs and get eliminated from the body.

It is normal for pulse rate to increase when taking a steam bath.

### Indications
* Obesity
* Skin diseases
* Asthma
* Allergies
* Tonsilitis
* Sinusitis
* Joint Pain / Stiffness
* Low BP
* Gynaecological Conditions
* Appendicitis Inflammation

### Contra Indications
* Burns / Bruises / Cuts on the Skin
  Steam has high penetration power. Taking a steam bath in these conditions will aggravate the situation
* High BP
  Although if the BP is under control, we can administer the steam bath by wrapping a wet towel around the patient's chest
* Heart Patients
* Internal Hemorrhage
* Bleeding Piles
* Hysteria
* Epilepsy
* Excessive Weak / Old Patients
* Pregnancy - DO NOT ADMINISTER in first and last trimester.
  Generally avoid during the rest of the pregnancy
### Considerations
* Do not administer during a fast
* If required, give enema before steam bath
* Should be administered either on an empty stomach, or at least after a 3-4 hour gap
* Head needs to be cold
* If patient is thirsty, have them drink water.
* If the patient feels nervous, stop the treatment immediately and sprinkle cold water on head and face
* For high BP patients, only when their BP is normal, wrap the chest area with a wet bandage before administering steam bath
* Take a 30 min break after Steam Bath before eating.
