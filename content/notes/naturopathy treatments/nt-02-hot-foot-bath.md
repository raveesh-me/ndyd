> A Hot foot bath is beneficial for all diseased above the legs

### Introduction
This treatment is given to patients of any disease that is above the legs. If preparation for steam bath is not available, hot foot bath can also be given in its stead.

### Requirements
- 1x Blanket
- 1x Thin cotton sheet
- 1x Large bucket
- 1x Small bucket
- 1x Mug
- 1x Small Towel
- 1x Chair / Stool
- 1x Rexine / Plastic Cover
- Hot Water
- Cold Water 
- Watch

### Temperature of Water
In hot foot bath, patient has to submerse their leg up to the calf in water. This water needs to be:

| Season | Temperature of Water |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| Summer | 104-115 F            |
| Winter | 115-120 F            |
### Principle
Vasodilation near the feet pulls the blood towards the blood towards the feet and away from the upper body.

### Method
- If enema is required, have the patient take an enema before the Hot Foot Bath
- Lay the blanket on the chair in a way that after the patient sits on the chair, the blanket can cover the patient with the bucket on all sides
- Lay the cotton sheet on the blanket in the same way
- Depending on the season, make the patient drink water
	- Normal water in summers
	- Lukewarm water in winters
- Make the patient undress and make him sit on the chair
- Take the large bucket and put warm water in it. 
	- Water should be as warm as the patient can take(within the range mentioned above)
	- Fill enough water to reach the patient’s ankle
- Make the patient put his legs in the warm water
- Cover the patient with the cotton sheet first and then with the woollen blanket as laid in the preparation
	- The bucket should come inside the cover, with no big gaps
- Cover the blanket with the rexine cover
- Wet the patient’s head and put a wet towel on top of the patient’s head
- We need to maintain the temperature of the hot water as per the patient’s endurance throughout the duration of the treatment.
	- Based on patient’s feedback, keep pouring more hot water to the bucket at regular intervals
- We also need to keep the patient hydrated and their head cool.
	- Keep pouring cold water on the patient’s head at regular intervals (based on feedback as well)
	- If the patient gets thirsty, make them drink cold water
- Once the duration of the treatment is up, help the patient out and have them immediately take a cold shower.
	- If the patient is weak or cold, rubbing their body with a wet towel will also suffice.
### Duration
The duration for which we keep the patient in a hot foot bath depends on the weather and the patient’s endurance.

| Condition  | Time Duration    |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Normally   | 20 minutes       |
| In Summers | 15 to 20 minutes |
| In Winters | 20 to 30 minutes |
### Action and Reaction
Keeping the feet in warm water results in vasodilation in the capillaries of the feet. This results in blood from the upper body flowing towards the feet. 
The blood/osmotic pressure above the hip reduces which results in toxins being pulled from the organs.
Bathing with cold water results in vasoconstriction which leads to increased blood flow throughout the body. This results in higher excretory organ function and the toxins getting out.
